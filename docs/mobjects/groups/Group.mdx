# Group

### Description

A `Group` is a `Mobject` that can contain others mobjects, including sub-groups.
Groups have additional spatial relationships for arranging their submobjects in a row, column, or grid, which are covered on this page.

#### Details

Groups are used for clear organization of related items.
Mobjects by default can add submobjects with `mob1.add(mob2)` but that should be used sparingly.

#### Constructor Parameters

- `mobjects` (tuple): Mobjects to add to the group.
- `kwargs` (dict): Additional arguments for `TransformableMobject`.

#### Attributes

- `submobjects` (List[Mobject]): List of mobjects contained in the group.

#### Methods

- `add(*mobjects: Mobject, insert_at_front: bool = False) -> Self`: Adds mobjects to the group.
- `set_color(color: ManimColor, family: bool = True) -> Self`: Sets the color of the group and its submobjects.
- `set_opacity(opacity: float, family: bool = True) -> Self`: Sets the opacity of the group and its submobjects.
- `arrange(direction: Vector3 = RIGHT, aligned_edge: Vector3 = ORIGIN, buff: float = DEFAULT_MOBJECT_TO_MOBJECT_BUFFER, center: bool = True) -> Self`: Arranges the submobjects in a specified direction.
- `arrange_in_grid(num_rows: int | None = None, num_cols: int | None = None, aligned_edge_within_row: Vector3 = UP, aligned_edge_within_col: Vector3 = LEFT, row_direction: Vector3 = RIGHT, col_direction: Vector3 = DOWN, buff_within_row: float = DEFAULT_MOBJECT_TO_MOBJECT_BUFFER, buff_within_col: float = DEFAULT_MOBJECT_TO_MOBJECT_BUFFER, buff: float | None = None) -> Self`: Arranges the submobjects in a grid.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Create a group with a square, an arrow, and a text label and set the group's color

```python
from smanim import *

square = Square()
arrow = Arrow.points_at(square.get_corner(UR))
group = Group(square, arrow)
label = Text("Upper right").next_to(arrow, UP)
group.add(label) # Just for demo of `add` function, label should be included in constructor here
group.set_color(GRAY)
canvas.add(group)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/group/ex1.svg"
  alt="Example 1"
  style={{ width: "10rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
#### Example 2

Create a group of 8 squares with different opacities and put them in a grid with 2 rows and 4 cols

```python
from smanim import *

squares = [Square(color=GRAY, opacity=i / 8) for i in range(8)]
group = Group(*squares)
group.arrange_in_grid(num_rows=2, num_cols=4)
canvas.add(group)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/group/ex2.svg"
  alt="Example 2"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
