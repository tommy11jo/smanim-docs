# Arrow

### Description

The `Arrow` class inherits from `TipableLine`, representing an arrow with optional tips at either end.
The default arrow has a tip only at the true "end" and has a drawing style with color set to WHITE.

#### Constructor Parameters

- `start` (Point3D | Mobject, default=LEFT): Starting point or Mobject.
- `end` (Point3D | Mobject, default=RIGHT): Ending point or Mobject.
- `buff` (float, default=0.0): Buffer distance from the start and end points. Positive buffs cause the arrow to shorten.
- `tip_length` (float, default=0.2): Length of the arrow tip.
- `tip_width` (float, default=0.2): Width of the arrow tip.
- `tip_scalar` (float, default=1.0): Scale factor for the tip size.
- `tip_shape` (class, default=ArrowTriangleFilledTip): Shape class for the arrow tip.
- `at_start` (bool, default=False): Whether to add a tip at the start.
- `at_end` (bool, default=True): Whether to add a tip at the end.
- `tip_config` (dict): Additional configuration for the tips.
- `kwargs` (dict): Additional arguments for `TipableLine`.

#### Attributes

- `start` (Point3D): Starting point of the arrow.
- `end` (Point3D): Ending point of the arrow.
- `length` (float): Length of the arrow.
- `midpoint` (Point3D): Midpoint of the arrow.
- `direction` (Point3D): Direction vector of the arrow.
- `angle` (Point3D): Angle of the arrow, in radians.
- `start_tip` (Mobject | None): Tip at the starting point.
- `end_tip` (Mobject | None): Tip at the ending point.

#### Methods

- `points_at(cls, mobject_or_point: Mobject | Point3D, direction: Vector3 = DOWN, length: float = 1.0, buff: float = TINY_BUFF, **arrow_config) -> Arrow`: Class method that creates an arrow pointing at the given mobject or point in the specified direction.

### Examples

#### Example 1

An arrow between two mobjects.

```python
from smanim import *

circle = Circle()
square = Square().shift(UP * 2 + LEFT * 3)
arrow = Arrow(start=circle, end=square, color=RED, buff=0.1)
canvas.add(circle, square, arrow)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/lines-and-arrows/arrow/ex1.svg"
  alt="Example 1"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>

#### Example 2

An arrow pointing at a corner of a square.

```python
from smanim import *

square = Square()
arrow = Arrow.points_at(square.get_corner(LEFT + UP), color=RED, length=0.5)
canvas.add(square, arrow)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

  src="/img/lines-and-arrows/arrow/ex2.svg"
  alt="Example 2"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
