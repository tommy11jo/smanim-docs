# Still Manim Intro

### Description

still-manim, or `smanim`, is a python library for drawing static graphics of conceptual content in domains like math and programming.
It's based on 3blue1brown's animation library, [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), except it is designed for static graphics and for running in the browser.

#### Details

Try it in the [web editor](https://idraw.chat)!
There, you can also see a few examples to get a feel for the the library.

### Running Locally

If you prefer to work locally, install still-manim with pip:

```bash
pip install smanim
```

Create a new file with a simple program:

```python title="hello_world.py"
from smanim import *

c = Circle(stroke_color=RED)
t = Text("Hello World")
t.next_to(c, UP)
canvas.add(c, t)
# canvas.draw() # use this command when in the browser
canvas.snapshot(preview=True) # use this command when local
```

And run the program to generate the diagram and preview it:

```python
python3 hello_world.py
```

<img
  src="/img/hello-world.svg"
  alt="Hello World Circle"
  style={{ width: "30rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
