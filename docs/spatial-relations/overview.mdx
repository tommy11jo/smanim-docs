# Overview

Spatial relations are used to position one mobject relative to another mobject.
The main spatial relations in smanim are `next_to`, `align_to`, `move_to`, and `to_edge`.
These functions live in the `Mobject` class, and any mobject can apply them.

This section also covers bounding boxes, which are used for accessing the corners, edge points, and center of a mobject.
