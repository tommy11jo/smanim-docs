# Close To

The `close_to` function positions one mobject near another, testing various directions to avoid collisions with the `obstacle_mobjects`.
This function is useful when `next_to` may cause overlaps with other mobjects.
Often used for labeling a submobject of a complex mobject like a network graph.

#### Parameters

- `mobject_or_point` (`Mobject | Point3D`): The target mobject or point to place this mobject near.
- `obstacle_mobjects` (`Sequence[Mobject]`): Mobjects that may cause collisions. Often, is `canvas.mobjects` (all mobjects added so far) or `some_mobject.get_family()` (a mobject and all its submobjects).
- `direction` (`Vector3`, default=`RIGHT`): The default direction to place this mobject relative to the target.
- `buff` (`float`, default=`DEFAULT_MOBJECT_TO_MOBJECT_BUFFER`): The buffer distance between the mobjects.

#### Example 1

A circle placed close to a rectangle, avoiding collision with a triangle.

```python
from smanim import *

circle = Circle(radius=0.5, color=DARK_GRAY)
rect = Rectangle(color=GRAY)
triangle = Triangle(color=GRAY).next_to(rect, RIGHT)
# direction RIGHT causes collision so the circle is positioned UP
circle.close_to(rect, [rect, triangle], direction=RIGHT)
canvas.add(circle, rect, triangle)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

### Example 2

Several labels placed close to submobjects of a complex mobject (like a network graph).
Avoids mobject collisions that `next_to` would cause.

```python
from smanim import *

vertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4)]
g = Graph(
    vertices=vertices, edges=edges, layout="circular", include_vertex_labels=True
)
labels = Group()
for v in g.vertices.values():
    t = Text("âˆž").close_to(v, g.get_family())
    labels.add(t)
canvas.add(g, labels)
canvas.draw(crop=True)
```
