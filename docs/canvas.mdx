# Canvas

### Description

A canvas is what is drawn on.
Mobjects can be added to the `canvas`: `canvas.add(mobject)`.
Added mobjects can be drawn: `canvas.draw()`.
The canvas is constructed using the default `CONFIG`: `canvas = Canvas(CONFIG)` and is available in the global scope.

#### Details

For comparison, a `Square` width by default is 2.

- The default frame height is 8.
- The default frame height is 14.222.
- The default frame center is the origin ORIGIN (0, 0, 0).
- The default background color is BLACK.

#### Attributes

- `mobjects` (Group): mobjects to be drawn

#### Methods

- `add(self, *mobjects: Tuple[Mobject, ...])`
- `remove(self, *mobjects: Tuple[Mobject, ...])`
- `draw(self, preview: bool = False, overwrite: bool = False, ignore_bg: bool = False, crop: bool = False, crop_buff: float = SMALL_BUFF)`: used in the browser (most common).
- `snapshot(self, preview: bool = True, overwrite: bool = False, ignore_bg: bool = False, crop: bool = False, crop_buff: float = SMALL_BUFF)`: use when working locally (less common).
- `set_background(self, color: ManimColor) -> Canvas`: default bg color is `BLACK`.
- `set_dimensions(self, width: int, height: int) -> Canvas`: where `width` and `height` are manim units. Often, `crop=True` in `draw()` is preferred because it avoids hardcoding.
- `set_global_text_styles(self, color: ManimColor | None = None, font_size: int | None = None, font_family: str | None = None) -> Canvas`: sets the default text style for any text mobjects that get created in the future (used to avoid repetition)

### Examples

#### Example 1

Show some text using the global default text color to black (instead of its default, white). Crop and ignore the background on the canvas.

```python
from smanim import *
canvas.set_global_text_styles(color=BLACK)
t = Text("Black text")
t2 = Text("Red text", color=RED).shift(DOWN)
canvas.add(t, t1)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```
