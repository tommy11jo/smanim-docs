# SurroundingRectangle

### Description

The `SurroundingRectangle` class, which inherits from `Rectangle`, represents a rectangle that surrounds a given `Mobject`.
It can be applied to emphasize a shape or some text to the user.

#### Constructor Parameters

- `mobject` (Mobject): The object to be surrounded by the rectangle.
- `stroke_color` (ManimColor, default=GRAY): The color of the rectangle's stroke.
- `buff` (float, default=SMALL_BUFF): The padding between the `Mobject` and the rectangle.
- `corner_radius` (float, default=0.0): Radius for rounding corners, in manim units (a reasonable value is often 0.1 to 0.3).
- `kwargs` (dict): Additional arguments for `Rectangle`.

#### Attributes

- `buff` (float): Padding between the `Mobject` and the rectangle.
- `surrounded` (Mobject): The `Mobject` that is being surrounded.

### Examples

#### Example 1

A surrounding rectangle around a square with custom padding.

```python
from smanim import *

square = Square(side_length=2, color=DARK_GRAY)
surrounding_rect = SurroundingRectangle(square, buff=0.5)
canvas.add(square, surrounding_rect)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```
