# Spatial Transformations

### Description

Spatial transformations are used to transform a mobject in space.
They typically operate as affine transformations to scale, shift, stretch, or rotate the mobject.

#### Details

All mobjects to date inherit from `TransformableMobject`, where these methods live.
However, some classes like `Text` override these transformation functions to provide more sensible defaults (e.g., Rotated text should rotate in space but remain upright by default).

#### Methods

- `rotate(angle: float = PI / 4, axis: Vector3 = OUT, about_point: Point3D | None = ORIGIN) -> Self`: Rotates the mobject by a specified angle around a given axis and about a specific point. By default, rotates about the 2D origin, which is the center of the canvas.
- `scale(factor: float, about_point: Point3D = ORIGIN) -> Self`: Scales the mobject by a given factor about a specified point. The center of the mobject does not change.
- `stretch(factor: float, dim: int) -> Self`: Stretches the mobject by a specified factor along a given dimension. The center of the mobject does not change.
- `shift(vector: Vector3) -> Self`: Shifts (or translates) the mobject by a specified vector.
- `stretch_to_fit_width(width: float) -> Self`: Stretches the mobject to fit a specified width.
- `stretch_to_fit_height(height: float) -> Self`: Stretches the mobject to fit a specified height.
- `scale_to_fit_width(width: float) -> Self`: Scales the mobject to fit a specified width.
- `scale_to_fit_height(height: float) -> Self`: Scales the mobject to fit a specified height.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Simple scaling of a square

```python
from smanim import *

square = Square(color=GRAY)
large_square = Square(color=GRAY).scale(2)
large_square.next_to(square, RIGHT)
canvas.add(square, large_square)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/spatial-transformations/ex1.svg"
  alt="Example 1"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>

#### Example 2

Stretching and rotating a simple number line (which contains vmobjects and text)

```python
from smanim import *

y_axis = NumberLine()
y_axis.stretch(0.5, dim=0)
y_axis.rotate(PI / 8)
y_axis.set_color(GRAY)
canvas.add(y_axis)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/spatial-transformations/ex2.svg"
  alt="Example 2"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
#### Example 3

Scaling of a group to fit the width of a text description

```python
from smanim import *

shape_group = Group(Square(z_index=1, color=GRAY), Circle(color=DARK_GRAY).shift(RIGHT * 0.5))
label = Text("""Mobjects take layer precedence based their z_index or when their z_indexes are equal the order they are added to the canvas.
The z_index of a mobject by default is 0.""", color=GRAY)
shape_group.scale_to_fit_width(label.width)
label.next_to(shape_group, UP, LEFT)
canvas.add(shape_group, label)
canvas.draw(crop=True, ignore_bg=True)
```

<img
  src="/img/spatial-transformations/ex3.svg"
  alt="Example 3"
  style={{ width: "20rem", height: "auto" }}
/>
